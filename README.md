# -Credence_Analytics_Proj

To run this project, you'll need to create an .env file with the following contents:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mybooksdb

I know you shouldnt be sharing your .env contents in public repo as you can see i have added the file in .gitignore alongside node_modules, but this project is on localhost and this project is for testing purposes , i figured to write it down in README.md.
